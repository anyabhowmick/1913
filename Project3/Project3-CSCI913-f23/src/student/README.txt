3. O(log n)
4. O(log b)




3. What is the runtime you’re claiming for your CodeBook methods (contains and getSequence)?
(use n = the number of characters in the codebook.)
4. What is the runtime of the HuffmanCodeTree.decode method, use b =the number of bits in
the binarySequence. (I.E. your answer should not include n at all.)
